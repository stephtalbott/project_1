# The Game of Simon

## Description

Are you looking to test your short-term memory skills with a visually mediocre browser rendition of the classic game of Simon? Then look no further, dear reader! 

The original game of Simon was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison of Marvin Glass and Associates, a toy design firm. Traditionally, the game is played by one player on a handheld device. Here, we are rendering that "device" to a computer screen so you can play it digitally!

## Getting Started
Game can be accessed at https://stephtalbott.github.io/project_1/

1. Press the Start Game button to get started. 
2. Watch and listen closely for the first square of the sequence to play.
3. It's your turn! Click the square you just saw the computer activate. 
4. Now it's the computer's turn again. The computer will now show the first square, plus another one. 
5. Your turn again! Try to click the squares in the same order. 
6. If you can correctly guess 5 rounds, you win! If you make a mistake at any point in the game, you lose. Better luck next time! 

## Planned Future Enhancements 
- ability to store a "high score" so the player can keep track of their progress over time 
- aesthetic improvements; allow users to choose their preferred color palette
