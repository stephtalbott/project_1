# The Game of Simon

## Description

Are you looking to test your short-term memory skills with a visually mediocre browser rendition of the classic game of Simon? Then look no further, dear reader! 

The original game of Simon was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison of Marvin Glass and Associates, a toy design firm. Traditionally, the game is played by one player on a handheld device. Here, we are rendering that "device" to a computer screen so you can play it digitally! 



As a player, you should be able to... 
- view a gameboard with four different colored squares that each have a different sound when clicked
- click a "start" button to begin the game 
- watch the game generate a flashing sequence pattern with different sounds for each square for you to try to repeat from memory, starting with just one flash
- continue playing the game with an increasingly longer pattern sequence to repeat if my pattern matches the game pattern, building off of the previous round by one flash/click
- see a level counter so I know how many rounds I've successfully completed
- win a game by correctly repeating the pattern 5 times
- click a "play again" button after losing to try again!
